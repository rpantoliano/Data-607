I assumed each cell of the table shown was a value to be represented in the CSV file, with blank cells representing an empty value.  The resulting file is:\n![Airline Data as a CSV file](data_csv.png)\n\n## Reading and initial processing of the CSV Data\nReading the initial file is easy, since R has a function to do so.\n```{r readfile}\nairline_df <- read.csv(\"Airline.csv\")\nprint(airline_df)\n```\n\nLooking at the dataframe, we notice that the column headers for the airline and the status of the observations are not meaningful, so we shall rename them:\n```{r add_header}\nnames(airline_df)[1] <- \"Airline\"\nnames(airline_df)[2] <- \"Status\"\nprint(airline_df)\n```\n\nWe also notice that, for the \"delayed\" data observations, we do not have the airline associated with those observations listed, so let us change that as well:\n```{r add_airline}\nairline_df[2,1] <- airline_df[1,1]\nairline_df[4,1] <- airline_df[3,1]\nprint(airline_df)\n```\n\n## Separating the data into various useful frames\n# Lengthening Data\nFirst, we can lengthen the data table so that each row contains the Airline, Status of Flight, City of flights, and # of flights of that type:  \n```{r lengthen_data}\nlong_df <- airline_df %>%\n                  gather(\"Location\", \"n\",3:7)\nprint(long_df)\n```\n\n# By Airline\n```{r by_airline}\n# Filter observation by airline\nalaska_df <- long_df %>% filter(Airline == \"Alaska\") %>% group_by(Location)\namwest_df <- long_df %>% filter(Airline == \"AM West\") %>% group_by(Location)\nprint(alaska_df)\nprint(amwest_df)\n```\nTotal number of flights to each location by each airline\n```{r total_flights}\nalaska_total <- alaska_df %>% group_by(Location) %>% summarise(total = sum(n))\namwest_total <- amwest_df %>% group_by(Location) %>% summarise(total = sum(n))\nprint(alaska_total)\nprint(amwest_total)\n```\n# By On time Flights\n```{r by_ontime}\n# On-time flights\nontime_df <-\n  long_df %>%\n  filter(Status == \"on time\") %>%\n  select(-Status) %>%\n  group_by(Location)\nprint(ontime_df)\n```\n\n# By Delayed Flights\n```{r by_delayed}\ndelayed_df <-\n  long_df %>%\n  filter(Status == \"delayed\") %>%\n  select(-Status) %>%\n  group_by(Location)\nprint(delayed_df)\n```",
