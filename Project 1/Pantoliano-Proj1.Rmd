## Background
This end of the project is incredibly simple.  The task is to load a CSV file containing movie titles and ratings into a data frame.

#Assumptions:
1) The file is named "ratings.csv"
2) The file is in the present working directory in which the R markdown file is executed.

## Code
```{r}
ratings_data <- read.csv("ratings.csv")
print(ratings_data)
```
